R-MERMAID
=========

A repo of useful R code for MERMAID analyses and figures.

Public dataset of underwater coral bleaching observations surveyed in the Yasawas, Ra, Ovalau and Leleuvia locations in Fiji collected between April-June 2019. Learn more about the rapid coral bleaching assessment here, \[linked phrase\] (www.wcs.org/coral)

We plan to add more resource code to support MERMAID analysis in the future.

MERMAID data can be used to create a histogram of coral bleaching and various maps of coral bleaching reports from the dataset. All code draws on a real dataset of bleaching observations (by coral genus) downloaded from MERMAID. \[link\] (www.datamermaid.org)

This histogram shows bleaching observations - % colonies with some level of bleaching (pale to recently dead) - binned into four groups.

This is a map of bleaching observations using ggplot2 maps.

This is the same bleaching map faceted by month.
